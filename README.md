learning flashcards from simple csv files, which can be loaded and stored to local computer

# idea
I am using Anki-Flashcards for a long time and I want my pupils to use Anki. But everybody is having iPads now makes it difficult to get Anki for them all. I was hoping to get something very simple running with csv-Files, which can be managed by 
every pupil on his own.
Besides I was playing around with ChatGPT, giving me insides to programming in a very quick and easy way.

# Remarks
The code is developing step by step in exchange with ChatGPT on new ideas, so it is currently not in a very ordered form. I hope I can improve this in the future during development
